## Problem 1

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The dataset has 15 variables, which are origin(weather station), year,
month, day, hour(time of recording), temp(temperature in F),
dewp(dewpoint in F), humid(relative humidity), wind_dir(wind direction
in degrees), wind_speed(wind speed in mph), wind_gust(gust speed in
mph), precip(precipitation in inches), pressure(sea level pressure in
millibars), visib(visibility in miles), and time_hour(date and hour of
the recording). The dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns. The mean
temperature is 39.5821229F.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

In this plot, the temperature increases as day passes. The temperature
doesn’t change much during high humidity days.

## Problem 2

``` r
P2_df = 
  tibble(
    ran_sam = rnorm(10),
    log_vec = ran_sam > 0,
    cha_vec = as.character(c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j")),
    fac_vec = factor(c("L1","L2","L3","L1","L2","L3","L1","L2","L3","L1"),
                     levels = c("L1","L2","L3"))
    )
```

``` r
mean(pull(P2_df,var=1))
```

    ## [1] -0.346126

``` r
mean(pull(P2_df,var=2))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(P2_df,var=3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(P2_df, var = 3)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(P2_df,var=4))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(P2_df, var = 4)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The first and second column can take the mean, which are numeric and
logical columns. Character and factor cannot take the mean.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(P2_df,var=2))
as.numeric(pull(P2_df,var=3))
as.numeric(pull(P2_df,var=4))
```

Logical vector can be converted to numeric values. Ture is 1 and false
is 0, so the logical vector has a mean. Character vector cannot be
converted to numbers. The letters in character vector does not have a
numeric meaning, so no numbers can represent the characters and no mean.
The numeric value of the factor vector shows the levels from 1 to 3.
There is no mean for the level values as it is meaningless.
